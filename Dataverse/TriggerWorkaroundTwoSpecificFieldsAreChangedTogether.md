**Workaround Dataverse Trigger for When Two Specific Fields Are Changed Together**

"When a row is modified" trigger in Power Automate (Dataverse) doesn't support directly filtering flows to run only when specific combinations of fields change (i.e., Field A AND Field B changed together). It triggers when any of the selected columns change (logical OR), not AND.
Hereâ€™s how to work around this limitation using conditional logic in your flow:
________________________________________
âœ… Step-by-Step Workaround: Trigger When Two Specific Fields Are Changed Together
ðŸ§© Assumptions
â€¢	Dataverse Table: MyTable
â€¢	Fields: fieldA, fieldB
â€¢	You want the flow to run only when both fieldA AND fieldB are changed in a single modification.
________________________________________
1. Trigger: When a row is modified (Dataverse)
â€¢	Table name: MyTable
â€¢	Scope: Choose based on your needs.
â€¢	Select columns: fieldA, fieldB (optional for performance â€” not mandatory).
________________________________________
2. Get the Previous Version of the Record
Since the trigger gives you only the new values, youâ€™ll need the previous values to compare what actually changed.

Option A: Use a "Get row" action
â€¢	Use a Get row by ID, referencing the same row (using Row ID from the trigger).
â€¢	But this gives the current version again â€” so you may need versioning logic.

Option B: Use Audit Logs (Complex)
If auditing is enabled in Dataverse, you could extract historical values â€” but this is not straightforward in Power Automate directly.
âœ” Best Simple Workaround: Store Previous Values in Shadow Fields
Create two shadow fields, e.g., prevFieldA and prevFieldB, and update them at the end of each flow run.
Then:

3. Condition: Compare Old and New Values
Add a condition block like this:
(fieldA != prevFieldA) AND (fieldB != prevFieldB)
Use expressions like:
and(
  not(equals(triggerOutputs()?['body/fieldA'], triggerOutputs()?['body/prevFieldA'])),
  not(equals(triggerOutputs()?['body/fieldB'], triggerOutputs()?['body/prevFieldB']))
)
This ensures the flow proceeds only if both values changed.
________________________________________
4. Do Your Logic
Only execute your desired logic (e.g., send email, update status, etc.) within the If true branch of the condition above.
________________________________________
5. Update the Shadow Fields
Update prevFieldA and prevFieldB with the new values of fieldA and fieldB respectively, so next time you'll have the old values for comparison.

âœ… Benefits of This Method
â€¢	Works within Power Automateâ€™s limitations.
â€¢	Doesnâ€™t rely on auditing or complex triggers.
â€¢	Gives precise control over field-change logic.

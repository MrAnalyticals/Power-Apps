In thia Repo I have Form Libraries, alo known as JavaScript files. These are used to dynamically run off Model Driven Power App forms. The objects (components) within a Form can be used to trigger these Form Libraries thus enhancng the user experience on those forms. Rather like Add-Ins for Office 365, in the past, these JavaScript libraries add additional functionality to the Power App.
